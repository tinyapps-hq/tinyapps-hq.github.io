# Join a Tournament

To accept an invite, simply enter the six-digit code that your host shared with you. You can also tap on a link that your host may have shared with you that already has the code embedded. Additionally, on iOS, you can have the host display the <a href="/docs/two-up/host/add-players#invite-players">QR code of your invite</a>, and you can scan it with your phone

:::caution

Invite codes are single-use and are tied to your unique player in the tournament. Do not share them with others. If you need another code, your tournament host can create a new one for you.
