# Lock Matches

import {SetupMenu} from "../../../src/components/Icon"

At any point, you, as the host, can lock matches so they cannot be
edited. It's recommended to do this at the conclusion of each session.

To lock all completed matches, tap the "Lock completed matches" from
the setup (<SetupMenu/>) menu

To manually lock a match, open the match and tap the "Host Locked"
checkbox
