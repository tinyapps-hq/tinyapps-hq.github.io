option from the Edit Tournament screen, and then tapping "Add
Session." Enter the session details, then tap "Save Session"

Once a session has been created, you can make it the current session
by tapping the checkbox on the "Sessions" screen.

## Change the current session

The current session appears on the tournament homepage for all the
tournament participants, and their match in that session is pinned to
the top of the list for easy access.

From the Edit Tournament screen, tap the **Current Session** item, and tap the checkbox next to the session you'd like to set as the current one. The public tournament page will be updated immediately.

## Handicapping

If you have selected a Course for your session, you can choose the handicap allowance. Doing so will show the relevant strokes for the match as dots (&bull;) next to the appropriate player on the score entry screens.
