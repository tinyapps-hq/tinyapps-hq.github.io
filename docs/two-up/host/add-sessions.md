Once a session has been created, you can make it the current session
by tapping the checkbox on the "Sessions" screen.

## Change the current session

The current session appears on the tournament homepage for all the
tournament participants, and their match in that session is pinned to
the top of the list for easy access.

From the Edit Tournament screen, tap the **Current Session** item, and tap the checkbox next to the session you'd like to set as the current one. The public tournament page will be updated immediately.

## Handicapping

If you have selected a Course for your session, you can choose the handicap allowance. Doing so will show the relevant strokes for the match as dots (<StrokeDot/>) next to the appropriate player on the score entry screens. The match card will also display each player's Course Handicap (CH) for the course. The difference between these values, based on the type of play and handicap allowance, determines the number of strokes a player receives in the match. 

Select the handicap allowance and then save the session to recalculate the strokes for the session.

:::caution

If you change a match after calculating the strokes, you'll need to re-save the Session in order for the strokes in each match to update.
