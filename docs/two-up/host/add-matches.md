# Add Matches

Once your players and sessions are entered, you're ready to create your matches and assign players.

## Generating Matches

The easiest way to add Matches to your tournament is to use the
(Re)Generate matches option under the setup menu. This will
automatically generate the right number of matches based on the number
of players you've entered, and the sessions you've setup.

## Manually Adding Matches

You can also manually create a match by navigating to a session and
then tapping the plus button to create a new match in that session.

If you manually add or remove a match, use the (Re)Number Matches option from the setup menu to correct match numbers starting at 1.

## Assigning Players

Once a match has been created, you can choose the players by tapping
the match to open it, then tapping on either the "Choose [Team]
Players" button or by tapping each side of the match card that's
displayed.
